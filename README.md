# What is this

Simply a repository to store specific versions of the `entt` single-header file, and make it compatible
with the `Hunter` package management system.

# Why is this called 'volt_entt' rather than 'entt'

Purely in the event that `entt` is added as a package to `Hunter` itself, there won't be any risk of a name
collision - ideally.
